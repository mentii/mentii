## About
Mentii was created as a senior project by 5 software engineering students at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu) as a part of the [College of Computing and Informatics](https://cci.drexel.edu). The project was created over the course of 9 months to fulfill a graduation requirement.

__Goal__: Provide all students with the experience of tutoring someone; naturally reinforcing their own understanding in the process.

Mentii is an application that students mentor which:
- Attempts to solve algebra problems, and intentionally fails.
- Allows students to guide the system to a correct answer, simulating the mentoring process.
- Will fail in an intelligent manner so that students are asked to provide guidance on topics and concepts that they are still solidifying their understanding on.
