## About
__Goal__: Provide all students with the experience of tutoring someone; naturally reinforcing their own understanding in the process.

Mentii is an application that students mentor which:
- Attempts to solve algebra problems, and intentionally fails.
- Allows students to guide the system to a correct answer, simulating the mentoring process.
- Will fail in an intelligent manner so that students are asked to provide guidance on topics and concepts that they are still solidifying their understanding on.
